In this Repository I have shared some of my Golang programs.

Right now on Apr 18th there are two main programs as below:
  
  1) First one reads End System's Network Interface Card and prints out the output
     In this program, I used MAP data structure to read and print out datas in a functional based approach. In the end of the program data is organized and      ready to be pushed into a DB
  2) The second program prints the environmental variables of the host system

More information regarding the functions can be found in the programs themselves.
